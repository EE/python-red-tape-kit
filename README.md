# Red Tape Kit

Python Red Tape Kit is a Python library that provides a structured approach to creating and managing documents (like PDF, docx). It uses Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to separate the definition of document content from its presentation.

## Key Features

- **AST-Based Document Definition**: Define the structure and content of your documents using AST. This allows for a clear separation of content and presentation, making your documents easier to manage and modify.

- **Flexible Document Rendering**: Once your document's content is defined, you can easily render it into a PDF, docx or other format with customizable mechanics.

- **Modular Design**: The library is designed with modularity in mind. You can easily extend and adapt it to fit your specific needs.
